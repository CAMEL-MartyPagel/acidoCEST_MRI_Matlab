 INSTRUCTIONS for cestFISP_Pagel4

 This FISP MRI pulse program from Bruker ParaVision 5.1 was modified by Marty Pagel
 and colleagues (especially Ed Randtke and Kyle Jones) to create a
CEST-FISP MRI acquisition method.  Please contact Marty at
 mdpagel@mdanderson.org or martypagel@gmail.com for questions or sugestions.

 This pulse program is provided for free to the MRI research community.
 Although this pulse program has worked on all Bruker MRI scanners
 with ParaVision 5.1 that have been tested to date,
 there is no guarantee that this pulse program
 will work on all Bruker MRI scanners.
 Also, while we are collegial researchers, we may not be able to provide
 assistance due to limited time and other priorities.

 This version was developed on July 29, 2018 and is known as he 4th version,
cestFISP_Pagel4.
Note that user-edited versions must start with a lowercase letter.  Therefore, 
I have named our method "cestFISP" taht starts with lowercase letters.

Version history:
Note that previous versions used additional names prior to 2018.
cestFISP_Pagel1 = written December 2011 at teh U of Arizona, included saturation period
cestFISP_Pagel2 = written May 2014 at the U of Arizona, included respiration gating
cestFISP_Pagel3 = written June 2018 at MD Anderson, inclded a new menu layout
cestFISP_Pagel4 = written July 2018 at MD Anderson, renamed variables and improved delays,
                  and improved the respiration trigger code


Installation Instructions:

You need a basic understanding of UNIX / LINUX commands to use these instructions.
There are four general steps (Steps 1-4 below).

1. Move the cestFISP_Pagel4 directory and files to /home/<your_login>/src/PV5.1 directory.  
If you do not have a "src" sub-directory
in your home directory, or a "PV5.1" subdirectory in your src directory, 
then create one (mkdir ~/src; mkdir ~/src/PV5.1').
Also, create "bin" and "bin/PV5.1" directories in your home directory (/home/<your_login>/bin/PV5.1).
The "bin" directory containes the compiled version of your pulse program, if you edit and recompile programs.

2. Copy files from the cestFISP_Pagel4 directory to the ParaVision directories.
Note that the commands below assume that your ParaVision 5.1 version is stored in a  directory
named "/opt/PV5.1".  Some Bruker scanners store their ParaVision 5.1 version in a directory 
named "opt/PV51".  Therefore, "cd /opt; ls" to determine which directory name your system uses.
Then modify the commands below as needed.

cp ~/src/PV5.1/cestFISP_Pagel4/cestFISP_Pagel4.so /opt/PV5.1/prog/parx/pub 
cp ~/src/PV5.1/cestFISP_Pagel4/cestFISP_Pagel4.ppg /opt/PV5.1/exp/stan/nmr/lists/pp
cp ~/src/PV5.1/cestFISP_Pagel4/cestFISP_Pagel4.4ch /opt/PV5.1/exp/stan/nmr/lists/pp
cp ~/src/PV5.1/cestFISP_Pagel4/cestFISP_Pagel4_Trigger.mod /opt/PV5.1/exp/stan/nmr/lists/pp

3.  Create a protocol file.
Most Bruker MRI scanners have a directory named 
/opt/PV5.1/exp/stan/nmr/parx/routine/S116/<your_routine_S116_directory_name>
where <your_login> is your login name. This is the directory where your
customized protocols are stored.  However, some Bruker MRI scanners use
a subdirectory other than "S116" for storing protocols, such as G060.  Therefore, you need
to check to determine if you have a directory named
/opt/PV5.1/exp/stan/nmr/parx/routine/S116/<your_routine_S116_directory_name>
or if there is a subdiretory with <your_routine_S116_directory_name>
somewhere else in /opt/PV5.1/exp/stan/nmr/parx/routine/

Then type the following command:
cp ~/src/PV5.1/cestFISP_Pagel4/cestFISP_Pagel4 /opt/PV5.1/exp/stan/nmr/parx/routine/S116/<your_routine_S116_directory_name>

Then edit this file in 
/opt/PV5.1/exp/stan/nmr/parx/routine/S116/<your_routine_S116_directory_name>
I prefer to use the UNIX/LINUX "vi editor".  But you can use other editors.  For example,
vi /opt/PV5.1/exp/stan/nmr/parx/routine/S116/<your_routine_S116_directory_name>/cestFISP_Pagel4
Then change "login" in this file to the target directory in the vi. Type:
:1,$s/<your_routine_S116_directory_name>/the_name_of_your_directory/g
Or find the three occurences of "<your_routine_S116_directory_name>" in this file and change to your sub-directory name in S116.
Then type escape, and type :wq

4.  Create files for Image Sequence Analysis
You can view your CEST spectrum in the Image Sequence Analysis tool, in the Image Display & Preocessing menu, Processing Submenu.
Check that you have the following two "isa" directories:
/opt/PV5.1/prog/curdir/<your_login>/ParaVision/isa/src
/opt/PV5.1/prog/curdir/<your_login>/ParaVision/isa/obj
then
cp ~/src/PV5.1/cestFISP_Pagel4/cest_Pagel_ISA /opt/PV5.1/prog/curdir/<your_login>/ParaVision/isa/src/
cp ~/src/PV5.1/cestFISP_Pagel4/cest_Pagel_ISA.so /opt/PV5.1/prog/curdir/<your_login>/ParaVision/isa/obj/

5.  Restart ParaVision
If ParaVision is running, stop ParaVision.
Then start ParaVision.
Start a New Patient, New Study, and New Scan.  You should be able to select 
"cestFISP_Pagel4" as your new scan protocol.



cestFISP_Pagel4 Parameters:
Edit Method to see all of the parameters.

Measuring Method = cestFISP_Pagel4

SSFP Mode = FID
	We use an unbalanced FISP acquisition method.  
	The balanced FISP acqusition method, also known as TRUE FISP
	causes banding artifacts across the image at high magnetic field strengths 
	(e.g., 7T) and with moderate B0 inhomogeneity
	that is common with a Bruker MRI scanner.  The unbalanced FISP does not have these same artifacts.
	The unbalanced FISP has a low Signal-to-Noise Ratio relative to 
	balanced FISP or other MRI acquisition methods such as RARE, MSME, etc.
	However, cest is a measure of Contrast-to-Noise, so a low SNR is acceptable 
	(as long as there is a reasonable signal level).

Presaturation Delay = 0.01 ms
        This delay is set to 10 microseconds by default, and therefore is negligible.
        The Presaturation Delay occurs before the loop of saturation pulses.
        For example, if a series of saturation periods of different lengths needs to be tested,
        but the total time of each experiment should be held constant (to maintain a consistent relaxation weighting
        for all scans), then the Presat Delay can be decremented as the saturation period is incremented.  In the example below,
        the .Length of the saturation pulse is 500 ms.
        Presat Delay = 0 ms, Number of Saturation Pulses = 6, and therefore total time = 3 sec
        Presat Delay = 500 msc, Number of Saturation Pulses = 5, and therefore total time = 3 sec
        Presat Delay = 1000 msc, Number of Saturation Pulses = 4, and therefore total time = 3 sec
        Presat Delay = 1500 msc, Number of Saturation Pulses = 3, and therefore total time = 3 sec
        Presat Delay = 2000 msc, Number of Saturation Pulses = 2, and therefore total time = 3 sec
        Presat Delay = 2500 msc, Number of Saturation Pulses = 1, and therefore total time = 3 sec

Number of Sat Pulses = 10
        NOTE: The total length of the saturation period is the .Length of a saturation puulse listed above,
        multiplied by the number of saturation pulses (See the "Number of Cest Pulses" parameter below).
        For example, a 600 msec .Length and Number of Cest Pulses = 10 is a 6 second saturation pulse.

        CAUTION: If respiration gating is used (Preparation Trigger is turned ON), then the
        pulse sequence will perform one ADDITONAL satturation pulse and then check the trigger.
        Therefore, set the number of saturation pulses to one less than the number that you actually want.
        For example, if you want to perform 10 saturation pulses at 600 msec for a total of 6 sec,
        And you want to use respiration gating, then set the number of pulses to 9, and 10
        pulses will actually be peformed.
        Note also that an 11th, 12th, etc. pulse may also be performed depending on the breathing
        of the mouse (see below for details).
        The Number of Sat Pulses must be at least 1.  Therefore, the pulse program will perform at 
        least 2 saturation pulses for the saturation period of a respiration-gated acquisition.

Sat Power = 4 uT
	You can enter the saturation power in microTesla.
	The Saturation Power and the Saturation Pulse Length determine 
	the flip angle of the saturation pulse:
        Z degrees of the flip angle = (X saturation power in microTesla)(42.58 Hz/microTesla)((1 cycle/sec)/Hz)
		(360 degrees/cycle)(Y .Length of 1 pulsa in sec)
        Or Z = (X)(Y)(15,328.8) 

        For example, 36,789.1 degrees = (4 uT)(0.6 sec)(15,328.8) 
	Note that if you change the Sat Power OR the asaturation pulse length, 
	then the Saturation flip angle will be recalculated.

Sat Pulse Shape = bp32
	bp32 is a block pulse.  Other pulse shapes can be selected.  Pulse shapes
	are stored in /opt/PV5.1/exp/stan/nmr/lists/wave/ . You can add other shaped
	pulses to this directory as needed.

Sat Pulse - expand this sub-menu
	.Length = the length of one saturation pulse
	.FlipAngle = the flip angle in degrees
	.Attenuation = the attenuation value that sets the saturation power
	The attenuation is determined from the flip angle and the calibration of the
	90 degree pulse when you first click Traffic-Light.
 	All of the other parameters in this sub-menu can be ignored.

The "range" parameters establish the saturation frequency list.  
You can acquire ranges of the CEST spectrum with different intervals.  
For example, you can set three ranges, where
the first range spans -12 to -3 ppm in 1 ppm increments, 
the second range spans -2.9 to +2.9 ppm in 0.1 ppm increments,
the third range spans +3 to +12 ppm in 0.25 ppm increments,
The following parameters show how to set up this example:
number of ranges = 3 (note that the remaining parmaters now have 3 boxes)
Begin Sat Freq range         = -12   -2.9    3
End Sat Freq range           =  -3    2.9   12
Set Freq Interval            =   1    0.1    0.25
number of Sat Freqs in range =  10    59    37

Note that the number of Sat Frequencies in each range is calculated from the other parameters.
Do not enter numbers for the "number of Sat Freqs in range" because they will be recalculated.
Instead, change the interval to change the number of sat frequencies in a range.
Also, the interval CANNOT be zero.  When you increase the number of ranges, the interval is zero by default.
You must change this zero to a positive number.  

Total Number of Sat Frequencies = the sum of "number of Sat Freqs in range" listed above (106 in this example)
	Again, this parameter is not set by the user.

SatFrqArray = not set by the user.  However, review the list to ensure that the saturation frequency list is correct.
	Divide the number of a saturation frequency in Hz by the magnetic field strength 
	(i.e., 300 MHz for a 7T magnet).
	Note that the exact Larmor Frequency of your magnet is used to set these 
	saturation frequencies, and the Larmor
	frequency is often not exactly 300.000000 Mz.

Do High Througput = No

Excitation Pulse Angle = This is the excitation angle for the FISP acquisition.
        Lower values reduce T2-weighting in the images.
        Higher values improve SNR at the expense of more T2-weighting in the data.
        We use a value of 15 degrees.
        Notably, CEST is a measure of CNR, where the contrast caused by saturation
        is relative to the image signal wwithout saturation.
        The image signal without saturation can have any signal level and T2-weighting.
        Then the change in signal (contrast) is measured
        when saturation is applied.  This same concept is used for Diffusion-weighted MRI.
        The initial MRI signal level, including any T2-weighting,
        can be any value, and the effect of diffusion then changes the contrast of the MR signal.

Echo Time = This is the TE for the FISP acquisition, and should be set as short as possible.

Repetition Time = This is the TR for the FISP acquistion, and should also be set as short as possible.

Number of Segments = 1
Segmenting model = not needed if the number of segments is 1, but is typically set to "sequential"

Scan Repetition Time = The time for the FISP acquisition.  

Number of Averages = 1.  Values other than 1 will cause the pulse program to 
	repeat the saturation frequency and sum the acquisition with the previous acquistion.

Number of Repetitions = Not Used (typically set to 1).  Note that we have used the "repetition loop" 
	in the Bruker pulse sequence to iterate the saturation frequency.  If the number of 
	repetititions is > 1, then the entire saturation freuqnecy list will be re-iterated.  For the
	example used in these notes, this would acquire a CEST spectrum from -12 to +12 ppm with 106 frequencies,
	the repeat this acquisition with another 106 frequencies, etc.  
	This can be helpful for acquiring kinetics data, where a series of CEST spectra 
	are continually acquired.  But otherwise set this parameter to 1.

Estimated Total Scan Time = calculated INCORRECTLY.  
	However, the Scan Control menu shows the correct total scan time and time remaining.

Derive Pulse Gains = Yes

Encoding - expand this sub-menu
	Phase Encoding Order = CENTRIC_ENC
		Use Centric Encoding so that the initial signal acquisition establishes 
		the signal level for the image.  The alternative is to use Linear Encoding.  
		However, some CEST contrast is lost between the time that the
		acuqision is started at the edge of k-space, and the time that signal is 
		acquired in the center of k-space.  During this time, T1 relaxation occurs 
		which reduces CEST contrast (T1 relaxation is the enemy of CEST).
		Therefore, use Centric Encoding.  See "Dummy Echos" below for more details.

Preparation Options - Expand this sub-menu
	SSFP preparation Mode = Alpha_2
	Dummy Echos = 8
		Setting Dummy Echos allows the magnetization to reach steady state 
		before data is actually acquired.  
		We use 8 dummy echos which seems sufficient for most samples.
		The Dummy Echos compensates for using Centric Encoding (described above).

Trigger Module= Set to OFF for no respiration gating.
	 	Set to ON for respiration gating
		If you select respriation gating, then the pulse sequence will perform the saturation period
		(10 pulses each for a 600 msec duration, for a 6 sec saturation period).  
		Then the pulse sequence will perform ONE ADDITIONAL saturation pulse
		and then check to determine if the trigger is active.  
		If the trigger is active, the pulse sequence will perform the FISP acquisition.
		If the trigger is not active, then the pulse sequence will perform 1 additional 
		saturation pulse (600 msec in this example),
		and then check if the trigger is active.  This loop continues until an active trigger 
		is detected after a saturation pulse.
		For this example, the total saturation perid is then 
		6.6, 7.2, 7.8, 8.4, etc., seconds.  We use 6.6 seconds for our minimum
		saturation period which is very close to 100% steady state, so that additional 
		saturation does not change the CEST signal.
		Use a Trigger Mode of "per_PlaseStep" and a Trigger Delay of 1.000 ms.  
		We use a SA Instruments respiration gating system,
		with "pulse invert" checked on, "Begin Delay" set to 200, 
		"Max Width" set to 400, and "Gates" checked on.
		
		IMPORTANT NOTE: Sime Bruker scanners use "trignl1" and uther Bruker scanners use "trigpl1".
		trignl1 appears to look for a negative change in voltage, while trigpl1 looks for a positive
		change in voltage, when teh trigger is evaluated. This version sues "trignl1".  I am testing other
		versions. - Marty Pagel, July 29, 2018 



How to use cestFISP_Pagel4:
1.  Acquire a high resolution MR image of your mouse or sample.  Multislice is OK for this image set.
2.  Select the single image slice that you want to image with CEST MRI.  
    cestFISP_Pagel4 only acuqires single-slice data. Make a note of the isodist parameter for this slice 
    (i.e., slice position in millimeters).
3.  Select New Scan and select cestFISP_Pagel4
4.  Use the Geometry Editor to Import Geometry from the high-resolution MR image acquired in step 1 above.
5.  Set the number of slices to 1 and set the isodist to the value for the single slice that you 
    want to acuqire (step 2 above).
6.  Select your CEST parameters (See the notes above).
7.  Ensure that your mouse or sample are at 37.0C plus or minus 0.2C 
    (plus or minus 0.5C may also be acceptable, but we set our tolerance to pulse or minus 0.2C).
8.  Ensure that your mouse is breathing consistently and slowly.  Note that you need a 
    ~450 msec window with no lung motion for best results.
    A breathing rate < 45 breaths per minute provides 1.33 seconds between breaths.  
    The mouse "gasps" for about 300 msec under anesthetic.  
    So you then have a ~1 second window to acquire your ~450 msec FISP acquisition. i
    Faster breathign rates may not allow enough time for FISP acquisition between breaths.
9.  Click the Traffic Light Icon. You are now acquiring cestFISP_Pagel4 data.



How to display a CEST Spectrum using Image Sequence Analysis.
You can view your CEST spectrum in the Image Sequence Analysis tool, in the Image Display & Preocessing menu, Processing Submenu.
In the Image Sequence Analysis tool,
click File / More Buttons
A new row of buttons appears at teh bottom of the ISA window.  Click on Define ROI... on that bottom row.
Define your ROI using the new ROI tool window that apepars.
In the ISA window, click on Function / Select ISA Function
Select the cest_Pagel_ISA function
Click on Calc. Points for ROI.  A vertical line of dots will appear on the graph.
Click on Initialize ISA.  The CEST spectrum will appear.  Note that the positive
saturation frequencies appear on the right, while CEST spectra shold be plotted with
positive saturation frequencies on the left.  Also, this procedure only displays
a CEST spectrum to view the quality of your data.  This tool does NOT analyze CEST spectra.



Parameters specific to the CEST saturation period:
PresatDelay = Delay before the saturation period

NumSatPulses =  Number of Saturation Pulses in the Saturation Period.
                All saturation pulses use the same pulse shape.  A 10 microsecond delay
                is placed between pulses.
SatPower = Saturation power
SatPulseShape = Saturation Pulse Shape
SatPulse.Length = length of a single saturation pulse in milliseconds
SatPulse.Flipangle = the flip angle of teh saturation pulse in degrees

Sat_range_number = number of saturation frequency ranges
Sat_range_start = start frequency of the saturation frequency range
Sat_range_end = end frequency of the saturation frquency range
Sat_range_interval = interval between saturation frquencies in the sat freuqnecy range
Sat_range_NumSatFrq = Number of saturation frequencies in the range

NumSatFrqTotal = Total number of saturation frequencies
SatFrqList = The list of the saturation frequencies, in units of Hz.



Advanced Notes about the pulse sequence timing:
The standard FISP has the following start to the pulse sequence:
FQ1 - D4 - FQ8 - 10u - 5 u - 10u - FQ=o1list - D10 - alpha2 - 10u PO:sp3 - 10u - D4 - ...
To see this pulse sequence, see Spectrometer Control Tool / Tools / Pulse Program Tool...

The cestFISP pulse sequence with NO respiration gating
has the following modification after the second 10u and before the FQ=o1list
GATEP - D5 - FQ=o4list - 10u - {mtc - 10u - P27} 
where a loop is dentoed with {} brackets.

This additional sequence is listed in cestFISP_Pagel4_Trigger.mod
The ppg and 4ch files simply defer to this Trigger.mod file.

After the GATEP command, the D5 delay (also known as D[5]) is applied, which is the Presat Delay.  
The pulse frequency is set to the value in the o4list, which takes 10u.
"mtc" is the start of the loop for the saturation pulse.
Then after another 10 usec delay, the P27 pulse is performed.  This is the saturation pulse.
Then the sequence loops to MTC until the number of CEST pulses is reached.
Then FISP acquisition begins.

The cestFISP pulse sequence WITH respiration gating
has the following modification after the second 10u and before the FQ=o1list
GATEP - D5 - FQ=o4list - 10u -  {mtc - 10u - P27} - 5u - {startgate - 5u - P27 - 30u - check_trigger} - endgate - MORE
where MORE at the end is:
for a Avance III system, 5u delay to set trignl1, adn 5 u delay to set GRADSYNC
for all otehr systems, 5u delay to set trigpl1

The first part of this pulse sequence is the same as the sequence with no respiration gating.
then after another 5 usec delay, another loop is performed, named "startgate".  
This is an additional saturation pulse beyond the number of pulses requested in the menu.
See the "CAUTION" message above about the Number of CEST Pulses.
Then the trigger is checked during a 30u delay.  This 30u is teh shortest delay when checking a trigger.
If the trigger is active, then there 1 or 2 additional delays (depending on the version of Avance hardware, 
and finally FISP acquisition begins.
If the trigger is NOT active, then the loop continues {5u - P27 - 30u}.
Note that this is an endless loop until the trigger is active.
